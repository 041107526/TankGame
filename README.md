The small game project, based on Java's object-oriented programming paradigm, integrates the use of object pools, 
IO streams, multithreading, and GUI. 

The project code comprises three main classes:
Source code: the game's entry, map class, tank class, bullet class, player base class, utility class (object pools, common methods, constants, etc.).
Game-related resources: Tank images, map element block images, sound effects, etc.
Level files: Record level information.
